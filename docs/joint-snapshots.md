# Joint snapshot metadata foundation: v0.1.0-alpha.25

The [alpha.27 follow-up](configuration-history.md) requires the configuration
term to equal the snapshot term when both refer to the same index.

This step adds an experimental snapshot representation for a joint configuration
effective at the included snapshot boundary. MRFTS002 records the old and new
sorted voter sets plus the configuration entry's index and term. Its index must
be positive and no greater than the snapshot index; its term must be positive and
no greater than the snapshot term. Both voter sets are nonempty, positive, sorted,
unique and individually bounded. The codec validates structure, not whether the
configuration was committed or belongs to an authenticated cluster.

The v2 byte layout is magic[8], snapshot index[8], snapshot term[8], old voter
count[4], application data length[8], configuration index[8], configuration
term[8], new voter count[4], old voter IDs[4 each], new voter IDs[4 each], opaque
application data, and CRC32[4] over all preceding bytes. Lengths and counts are
bounded before allocation. Fixed snapshots continue to encode as MRFTS001 with
exactly the previous bytes; a golden v1 image tests compatibility. The standalone
snapshot store can export and load v2 images for testing or offline tooling.

This is a format and offline persistence foundation, not live joint consensus or
complete configuration history. A bound memory or durable store can install and
recover a joint snapshot when its persisted voter list matches the snapshot's old
voter set. Raft startup and RPC paths still reject joint snapshots, and compaction
still creates only fixed-voter snapshots. A covered snapshot is acknowledged only
after its prefix identifies the supported v1 format, including when the prefix
arrives in several chunks. Unsupported joint images are rejected without
replacing application data or publishing a joint snapshot. A valid higher-term
RPC header can still update durable hard state before its unsupported snapshot
contents are recognized. These rules avoid falsely acknowledging a joint image
merely because its index is already committed locally.

Older binaries do not understand MRFTS002 and may acknowledge an already-covered
image without checking its version. Do not send or activate joint snapshots in a
mixed-version cluster. Future live use requires an upgrade of every voter, a
defined compatibility protocol, replicated configuration entries, durable and
snapshot recovery of configuration history, transition rollback rules and dual
quorum handling throughout the protocol. This experimental v2 format may change
before those semantics are implemented. A standalone export is not proof that a
configuration is committed and is not an authoritative Raft checkpoint.

Tests cover a golden v1 image, joint round-trip, every-byte corruption and
truncation, semantic corruption with valid CRC, bounds and ordering, standalone
publication, bound durable round-trip, runtime rejection without rewriting the
image, and network rejection both above and below the commit boundary. They also
cover a supported v1 prefix split across chunks. The snapshot struct's
in-memory layout changes; rebuild the library and dependents together. Self-review
checked version dispatch, bounds, immutable voter binding, covered acknowledgments
and fail-closed recovery. No independent reviewer approval is claimed.

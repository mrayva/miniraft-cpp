# Offline configuration log scan

`ScanConfigurationHistory` validates a retained suffix starting at a trusted
configuration history at the snapshot boundary. It returns the history at the
caller-supplied commit index and at the end of the suffix. The two results make
it possible to distinguish the configuration in that committed prefix from a
later configuration record, including after a suffix is replaced. A malformed
entry anywhere in the suffix fails the entire scan; the scanner does not decide
whether a damaged tail may be truncated.

The caller must independently establish the baseline and commit index: the scan
does not prove that any entry is committed, recover a commit index, authenticate
the snapshot, or establish cluster identity. A fixed v1 snapshot does not identify
its latest configuration entry, so its configuration identity must come from
other trusted information. Experimental stable and joint snapshots contain that identity and the scan
checks that the supplied baseline matches it. The scan checks snapshot and log
boundaries, bound fixed voters, terms, configuration predecessors, and transitions.
It requires a consistent, externally serialized view of the state; it does not
mutate storage, apply entries, activate voters, or change Raft roles.

For ordinary entries, the scan trusts term and flag metadata from the storage
backend, which must validate its own records. Memory and durable backends avoid
copying ordinary payloads; external backends using default metadata accessors may
read full entries. Configuration records are read and validated in full.

Configuration entries and configuration snapshots remain rejected by the live
runtime. Bound in-memory and durable stores can retain stable or joint metadata
snapshots for offline validation; `snapshot.Voters` must match the persisted
binding. For joint snapshots, the scanner also requires the baseline's old voter
set to match that binding. Tests cover durable restart and reject a baseline that
differs from the persisted binding. Live membership activation, commit rules,
snapshot installation across transitions, and recovery into an active Raft
configuration remain future work.
